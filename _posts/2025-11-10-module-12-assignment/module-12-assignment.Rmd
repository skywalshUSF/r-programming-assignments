This is my Module 12 blog post for LIS4370.

## Task: 1 - Create an R Markdown File

In RStudio, go to File, New File, R Markdown… and choose HTML output.

Give it a title (e.g., “My R Markdown Primer”) and author metadata.

### I completed this task successfully

## Task: 2 - Populate the Document

### Write sections that include:

### A brief introduction explaining what R Markdown is.

```{r echo=TRUE}
# R Markdown is a document type that has the capability to combine r code and
# many other types of text into one document or file in various formats.

# If I were to create a markdown file in RStudio, it would have a .rmd file and
# some metadata at the top as the head that talks about or gives information
# about the document. I can add text, images, and even links to other webpages
# using HTML, and then add executable chunks of R code that will be run when
# the markdown file is knitted or compiled.
```

### At least one narrative paragraph (Markdown text).

For the following example, I will load the corrplot R package which does not

contain any built-in example datasets of its own. So to use the package, I must

first load a dataset from base R, compute the correlation matrix using the cor()

function, and then pass that matrix to the corrplot() function. The cor() makes

a table of correlations coefficients between the possible pairs of variables

and the corrplot() function creates a nice visualization of the rounded results.

### At least one LaTeX math expression (e.g., inline $alpha + beta = gamma$ and a displayed equation).

This is an inline equation: if $e=mc^2$ then:

for $m = 100$, $c=299,792,458$

$e = 100*299,792,458^2$ is $=8.9875518e+18$

### At least two executable R code chunks that:

### Load a library or dataset.

```{r}
#| error: TRUE
#| echo: TRUE
#| eval: TRUE
#| file: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/skywalshUSF/RProgrammingFall2025WalshSkylar/refs/heads/main/R/Assignment_12_1.R
```

### &

### Run a simple analysis or generate a plot (e.g., summary statistics or ggplot2 chart).

```{r Load library, data, and plot, echo=TRUE}
#| error: TRUE
#| echo: TRUE
#| eval: TRUE
#| file: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/skywalshUSF/RProgrammingFall2025WalshSkylar/refs/heads/main/R/Assignment_12_2.R
```

## Task: 3 - Compile and Review

### Knit the document to HTML (or PDF) and save the output.

### Compare the source .Rmd file side‑by‑side with the rendered output.
### Note any formatting surprises or tips you discovered.

Here is a screenshot of the code in rstudio:

### A concluding reflection on your experience using R Markdown vs. writing plain reports

In conclusion, the experience from writing plain reports to using R Markdown is an interesting shift that offers significant advantages, despite a notable initial hurdle. The primary challenge lies in the steep learning curve associated with mastering R Markdown's syntax, integration of code chunks, and understanding its various output formats and customization options. This initial time investment can be a deterrent for those accustomed to the immediate familiarity of traditional word processors.

However, the benefits of practicing R Markdown ultimately far outweighs this initial difficulty. The fundamentals of programming ensure that narrative text, code, and results are integrated seamlessly, leading to reports that are fully reproducible, dynamic, and less prone to manual errors. The ability to generate professional quality outputs in multiple formats like, PDF, HTML, and Word from a single source file greatly enhances efficiency and consistency as well. While the initial learning curve requires commitment, the resulting automation, reproducibility, and flexibility transforms the reporting process, making R Markdown a great choice for data science and analytical driven communication.
