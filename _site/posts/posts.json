Define and Inspect Your Data\r\nIn R, create vectors (correcting any syntax issues):\r\n\r\n\r\nName <- c(\"Jeb\",\"Donald\",\"Ted\",\"Marco\",\"Carly\",\"Hillary\",\"Bernie\")\r\nABC_poll <- c(4,62,51,21,2,14,15)\r\nCBS_poll <- c(12,75,43,19,1,21,19)\r\n\r\n# Combine into a data frame\r\ndf_polls <- data.frame(Name, ABC_poll, CBS_poll)\r\n\r\n# Use str() and head() to inspect your data frame.\r\nstr(df_polls)\r\n\r\n'data.frame':   7 obs. of  3 variables:\r\n $ Name    : chr  \"Jeb\" \"Donald\" \"Ted\" \"Marco\" ...\r\n $ ABC_poll: num  4 62 51 21 2 14 15\r\n $ CBS_poll: num  12 75 43 19 1 21 19\r\n\r\nhead(df_polls)\r\n\r\n     Name ABC_poll CBS_poll\r\n1     Jeb        4       12\r\n2  Donald       62       75\r\n3     Ted       51       43\r\n4   Marco       21       19\r\n5   Carly        2        1\r\n6 Hillary       14       21\r\n\r\nTask 2. Compute Summary Statistics\r\n\r\n\r\n# Compute the mean, median, and range for each poll:\r\n\r\n# Here is the mean, median, and range for the ABC polls\r\nmean(df_polls$ABC_poll)\r\n\r\n[1] 24.14286\r\n\r\nmedian(df_polls$ABC_poll)\r\n\r\n[1] 15\r\n\r\nrange(df_polls$ABC_poll)\r\n\r\n[1]  2 62\r\n\r\n# Here is the mean, median, and range for the CBS polls\r\nmean(df_polls$CBS_poll)\r\n\r\n[1] 27.14286\r\n\r\nmedian(df_polls$CBS_poll)\r\n\r\n[1] 19\r\n\r\nrange(df_polls$CBS_poll)\r\n\r\n[1]  1 75\r\n\r\n# Add a column for the difference between CBS and ABC:\r\ndf_polls$Diff<-df_polls$CBS_poll-df_polls$ABC_poll\r\n\r\n# Here is a bar chart that shows the difference or discrepancies\r\nlibrary(ggplot2)\r\n\r\nggplot(df_polls,aes(x=Name,y=Diff,color=Diff,fill=Diff))+\r\n  geom_bar(stat=\"identity\")+\r\n  ggtitle(\"Difference between CBS poll and ABC poll\")\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTask 3. Discuss and Reflect\r\nOn your blog, write 2-3 paragraphs addressing:\r\nKey patterns you observe (e.g., which candidate shows the largest discrepancies).\r\nI was able to observe multiple key patterns. Both ABC and CBS polls show that Donald had the highest values in the polls, whereas Carly had the lowest values in the polls. The mean of ABC polls, 24.14286, and the mean of the CBS polls, 27.14286, indicates that both mean values are close to each other and are somewhat similar. The median of ABC polls, 15, and the median of the CBS polls, 19, indicates that both median values are close to each other and are somewhat similar, but a difference of 4 could be significant. The range of ABC polls, from 2-62, and the range of the CBS polls, from 1-75, are somewhat similar. Donald had the largest discrepancies with a difference of 13 between the ABC_poll and the CBS_poll.\r\nImpact of using made‑up data—what limitations does this introduce\r\nThe impact of using made-up data is significant. When making up numbers, the data can influence believers that it can be true. There could be a Fox News poll online that shows Donald getting the highest value. There are some limitations to this though. The data constantly changes in a poll before the final result, and the numbers may not accurately represent the polls if the data was not retrieved at a later time after it has been fully gathered.\r\nHow you might collect or validate real poll data in a true analysis.\r\nI might collect or validate real poll data in a true analysis by showing data from side-by-side instead of only showing differences. Showing data from side-by-side gives a better graphical representation of the actual numbers that are viewed and provides an easier comparison. It also helps to have a large sample size and to verify that the data from any particular source is accurate.\r\nInclude your R code (in a code chunk) and the generated plot.\r\n\r\n\r\nlibrary(tidyverse)\r\nlongData<-df_polls|>\r\n  select(Name,\r\n         ABC_poll,\r\n         CBS_poll) |>\r\npivot_longer(cols=c(\"ABC_poll\",\"CBS_poll\"),names_to = \"Poll\")\r\n\r\ndf_polls$Name<-as.factor(df_polls$Name)\r\n\r\nggplot(longData, aes(x=Name,y=value,colour=Poll,fill=Poll))+\r\n  geom_bar(stat = \"identity\",position = \"dodge\")+\r\n  geom_text(aes(label=value),vjust=-0.5,hjust=0.5)+\r\n  ggtitle(\"ABC vs. CBS Poll Data by Candidate\")\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHere is a link to my blog and a screenshot of my updated github repo\r\nhttps://lis4370-r-programming-journal.netlify.app/\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

The methods in the “readr” and “tidyr” packages to read and write data files, save data, handle missing values, expand tables, and split cells all seem very familiar to me.\r\nTask 2.

Also, the variable “someData” does not exist. In order to use these two variables, they have to be declared before they are used as arguments for functions. The only variable that can be used in the “myMean” function would be “assignment2” because it is the input variable for the function.\r\nHere is a corrected version of “myMean” that correctly returns the mean of “assignment2”\r\n\r\n\r\n# The corrected function\r\nmyMean <- function(assignment2) {\r\n  return(sum(assignment2) / length(assignment2))\r\n}\r\n\r\n# Call the corrected function\r\nmyMean(assignment2)\r\n\r\n[1] 19.25\r\n\r\nHere is a screenshot that displays my GitHub repository updated with the blog link and corrected myMean function:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

The process\r\nbegan with going to the R project website to download the file for my operating\r\nsystem, and then run the installer. Once it was installed, I was able to go to\r\nthe website that allowed me to download the desktop installer for RStudio.\r\nThe main issue I encountered during installation was that it was difficult to\r\nhave the right Windows installer to be able to download it successfully. This\r\nproblem is what caused me to install RStudio repetitively. The way I resolved\r\nthis problem is that I got the right runtime application that supports the\r\ninstallation requirements for RStudio.\r\nIn terms of my system details, I ran a Windows 11 operating system on my PC, the\r\nR version that I currently have is R 4.4.2, and RStudio version is 2024.12.0.467.\r\nTask #4 Read Foundational Chapters\r\nAn R vector is an object or entity that acts as a container to store data. The\r\nvector is the simplest way to store more than one data value in R programs.\r\nVectors are important for data analysis because they can hold different data\r\ntypes or modes in one container. After storing data types in the container, R\r\nprograms and applications can iterate over the elements in the vector and\r\nperform many different types of operations on the different modes or types of\r\ndata contained in the vector for further analysis and extracting meaning out of\r\nlarge data sets. Elements in vectors can be modified and updated, which makes\r\nthem flexible and versatile, so if data changes, a vector is a good way to keep\r\ntrack of variables.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
